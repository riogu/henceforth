#T Lexical Structure
This section describes the basic lexical elements that make up Henceforth source code.

## Comments
Line comments are indicated by `//`. Block comments are opened with `/*` and closed with. `*/`, and can be nested.
```
  // this is a comment

  /*
    this is also a comment
  */

  /*
    /*
        this is a nested comment
    */
    this is still a comment
  */
```
## Identifiers
Function and variable identifiers can contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `_`, except for the first character, which can't be a number.
```
add // valid
getValue2 // valid
_private // valid

2var // invalid (starts with number)
my-function // invalid (has hyphen)
hello world // invalid (has space)
```

## Literals
Integer literals represent whole numbers:
```
42
-17
1000000
```

Floating-point literals represent decimal numbers:
```
3.14
-0.5
2.0
```

String literals are enclosed in double quotes:
```
"Hello, World!"
""
"Line 1\n Line 2"
```

The following escape sequences are allowed:
```
\n newline
\t tab
\\ backslash
\" double quote
\r carriage return
```

Boolean literals represent truth values:
```
true
false
```

Tuple literals group other literals together:
```
(5 3 "string")
(5.25 "test" true)
```

## Keywords
The following identifiers are reserved as keywords and can't be used as an identifier.
```
fn
while
continue
break
return
let
if
else
false
true
i32
f32
str
bool
```

## Operators
Henceforth provides several categories of operators.

**Arithmetic Operators**
```
+    addition
-    subtraction
*    multiplication
/    division
%    modulo
```
**Comparison Operators**
```
==   equal to
!=   not equal to
<    less than
>    greater than
<=   less than or equal to
>=   greater than or equal to
```

**Logical Operators**
```
&&   logical AND
||   logical OR
!    logical NOT
```

**Special Syntax**
```
@    stack block indicator
()   tuple constructor/stack block delimiter
:    function signature separator
->   return type indicator/argument redirection
{}   block delimiters
;    statement terminator
:=   copy top value to variable
&=   pop to variable
```
