# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of the Henceforth language.

This book will help you install all the necessary tooling, and build up your knowledge of Henceforth from the most basic concepts to the most advanced.
For more experienced developers who want to contribute, there is also a detailed language specification.

## How to read this book

You don't have to read everything in order. Feel free to:
- Start with the topics that interest you most.
- Use the sidebar for quick navigation.

If you're new, we recommend starting with the **Getting Started** section, so you can get all the tools and get a glimpse on what the language offers. After that, go through the language reference in whatever way you want.

## Contributing

If you find any issues on this book or on the language itself, contributions are always welcome! Check out the project's [repository](https://github.com/riogu/henceforth) or open an issue with your feedback.
